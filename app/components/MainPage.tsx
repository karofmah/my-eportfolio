  const experienceDescription=["In August 2022, I secured a job as a mentor at MentorNorge, which is the country's largest private tutoring provider. This position has provided me with the opportunity to assist students with homework, subjects, and other academic tasks while simultaneously fostering motivation and a desire to learn. The reason I applied for this job was to instill a sense of mastery in the students, thereby increasing their motivation for schoolwork.", 
  "As a mentor, my primary focus is on teaching mathematics at the primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary levels. My responsibilities include planning instructional sessions and tailoring the teaching approach to each individual student. Consequently, the instruction can vary from one student to another and depends on their proficiency in different topics. Additionally, monitoring the student's progress throughout the year is crucial in determining the trajectory of the instruction. This is something a mentor must observe and adjust accordingly.",
  "Through my experiences, I have learned that establishing a strong rapport with individuals is essential, as well as implementing a peer-to-peer approach. I have also acquired some effective communication methods that can be useful tools for teaching complex subjects to others. This not only applies to educational contexts but also in the context of project work."]

My group consisted of 7 students, and the purpose was to create a full-stack application that may decrease food waste in households. In this project I fulfilled my role as a scrum master, but I also worked on the back-end of the project as a developer. Therefore, I contributed to sprint ceremonies. I also helped my team by writing a part of the final report. This project enhanced my competence in being able to share and disseminate information and knowledge with team members and clients. I also gained more experience in evaluating other peopleâ€™s work. </>,

My group agreed to execute the project with NTNUI e-sport as the client. The project consisted of several components, including planning, back-end and front-end development, database integration, as well as a final report. In this project, my main contributions involved project planning, focusing on the back-end of the system, and writing the final report. Through this project in IDATT1002, I have acquired the ability to work efficiently and purposefully in a team towards a common goal. To achieve this, I applied programming expertise in conjunction with system development methodologies.</>,
